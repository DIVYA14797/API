        "Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating) is an ensemble learning technique that reduces overfitting in decision trees through several mechanisms:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Variability Reduction: Bagging generates multiple bootstrap samples (random samples with replacement) from the original dataset and trains a separate decision tree on each sample. Since each tree is trained on a slightly different subset of the data, they will have different biases and capture different aspects of the underlying data distribution. When the predictions of these diverse trees are combined (usually by averaging for regression or voting for classification), the variability of the ensemble model is reduced, leading to better generalization performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Decreased Sensitivity to Individual Outliers or Noisy Data Points: Decision trees are susceptible to overfitting when trained on noisy datasets or datasets with outliers. By training multiple trees on different subsets of the data, bagging reduces the impact of individual outliers or noisy data points on the overall model. Outliers may not be present in every bootstrap sample, so their influence on the final prediction is diminished when aggregating predictions from multiple trees.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Stabilization of Model Complexity: Decision trees are prone to high variance, especially when they are deep and complex. Bagging tends to stabilize the complexity of individual trees by randomly sampling subsets of the data during training. Each tree in the ensemble is typically trained on a smaller subset of the features as well, further reducing the risk of overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Improvement in Generalization Performance: By reducing the variance of individual trees and improving their generalization performance, bagging produces an ensemble model that often achieves better performance on unseen data compared to a single decision tree. This is because the ensemble model is less likely to overfit to the training data and can capture more robust patterns in the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, bagging effectively reduces overfitting in decision trees by leveraging the diversity among multiple trees trained on different subsets of the data. By averaging or combining the predictions of these trees, bagging produces a more stable and accurate ensemble model that generalizes well to unseen data."

The role of ensemble size is crucial in determining the performance and behavior of the bagging ensemble. Here are some considerations regarding the ensemble size in bagging:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Trade-off between Bias and Variance: Increasing the ensemble size tends to reduce the variance of the ensemble model. More models in the ensemble provide a more robust and stable estimation of the target variable by averaging or voting over a larger number of predictions.
